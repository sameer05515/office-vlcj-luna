/**
 * Demonstration of the synchronous approach to media player programming when
 * using media player condition objects.
 * <p>
 * This example asynchronously parses the media to get available meta data.
 * <p>
 * This is only useful as an example - in practical terms it is much simpler to
 * use the synchronous {@link MediaPlayer#parseMedia()} method.
 * <p>
 * Specify the MRL for the media on the command line.
