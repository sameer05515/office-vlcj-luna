/**
 * This test demonstrates how to manually handle the playing of YouTube videos.
 * <p>
 * Ordinarily, vlcj will play YouTube videos automatically if you simply invoke
 * {@link MediaPlayer#setPlaySubItems(boolean)}. This will instruct the media player to
 * automatically play any sub-items that get created.
 * <p>
 * To play a YouTube video with vlc, vlc is given the http: "watch" URL - this is not itself a
 * streaming MRL, it is a web-page. This web-page is then scraped, by a LUA script inside of vlc,
 * to locate the actual streaming MRL. If the vlc LUA script finds the MRL, then a sub-item gets
 * created containing that MRL.
 * <p>
 * This sub-item MRL must then itself be played.
 * <p>
 * At this point, either the movie will start playing, or the vlc LUA script did not find the MRL,
 * so it falls back to a "secondary" API which attempts to scrape the streaming MRL in a different
 * way. The result of this secondary API is yet another sub-item, (i.e. sub-item of the sub-item of
 * the original media), and you play that.
 * <p>
 * That all sounds long-winded and complicated, but in essence, to manually handle YouTube videos,
 * you simply play your URL, and in the "finished" event handler you simply keep playing the first
 * sub-item until there are no more.
 * <p>
 * Note that the primary API is the preferred API - the vlc LUA script is out-of-sync with the
 * YouTube web-page format. Ideally the LUA script would be changed. The whole scheme is brittle
 * since the YouTube web-page format could change at any time and be incompatible with the vlc LUA
 * script.
 * <p>
 * The secondary API is invoked by the vlc LUA script as a last-resort.
 * <p>
 * <em>A future version of vlcj will likely support this automatically.</em>
