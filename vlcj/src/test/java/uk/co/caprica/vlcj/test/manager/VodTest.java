/**
 * A very simple test showing the absolute basics of using the media manager (VLM)
 * for video-on-demand.
 * <p>
 * The client may of course be a vlcj client application, the vlc application
 * itself or any other client that can play RTSP streams.
 * <p>
 * Inputs/outputs are flexible - you do not have to play a <em>file</em>.
 * <p>
 * The native media manager (VLM) is quite basic - it is probably easier to build
 * a broadcast server or video-on-demand server in Java.
